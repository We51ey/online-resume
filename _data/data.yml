        + Project content: I developed a user interface using PyQt to collect voice data samples via a mobile device, with each recording segment being 10 seconds long. The recorded audio is converted into spectrograms, and some of the data is augmented. I then used the LBP (Local Binary Patterns) algorithm for pattern matching and employed various evaluation algorithms to assess the performance of the machine learning model. Additionally, I created a PyQt-based interface for real-time speaker recognition using a 'sliding window' approach.Subsequently, I collected more samples and built a neural network model based on MobileNet to train these samples, achieving an accuracy of 92%..

Data on key points of the human body are collected and machine learning is used to realize the auto movement. And I use classifier of random forests to recoginze some specific posetures of the human body to control the drone.

#     Publications can include academic journal articles, conference papers, book chapters, reports, or other written works. In this section, you should list the title of the publication, the names of any co-authors, the name of the publication or conference, the date of publication, and any other relevant details.

#     If you have a long list of publications, you may want to consider including only the most relevant or significant publications on your resume. Alternatively, you could create a separate publication list and provide it as a separate document, either in your application materials or upon request.

#     Including a publication section in your resume can help demonstrate your expertise and credibility in your field, and can help you stand out from other candidates. However, if you do not have any publications to list, it is not necessary to include this section in your resume.

#     The organization section in a resume, specifically for social contexts, is a section where you can showcase any relevant involvement or leadership positions in social, cultural, or community organizations. This section can highlight your commitment to social causes and your ability to work collaboratively with others towards a common goal.

#     In this section, you can list the name of the organization, your role and responsibilities, the duration of your involvement, and any significant achievements or accomplishments. You can also mention any skills or qualities you gained from your involvement, such as leadership, teamwork, communication, or problem-solving skills.

#     This section can be especially valuable for candidates seeking positions in the non-profit sector, social work, or community engagement roles, where experience in social or cultural organizations can demonstrate a genuine passion for social causes and a willingness to work collaboratively towards social change. However, it is important to only include organizations that are relevant to the job you are applying for, and avoid listing organizations that may be controversial or potentially offensive.

#     The interests section in a resume typically refers to a section where you can mention your hobbies, interests, and activities outside of work or school. This section can give potential employers a better idea of your personality, your values, and your interests beyond your professional experience.

#     Including an interest section in your resume can be helpful if your interests are relevant to the job you are applying for, such as if you are applying for a job in a creative field and your hobbies include painting or writing. It can also be useful if you are applying for a job where teamwork or social skills are important, and you can mention interests that demonstrate those qualities.

#     However, it is important to be selective when including an interest section in your resume, and to choose interests that are appropriate and professional. Avoid including controversial or potentially offensive interests, and focus on interests that showcase your positive qualities and strengths.

#     A reference section in a resume is a list of individuals who can vouch for your skills, work ethic, and character. These individuals are typically former managers, colleagues, or mentors who have worked closely with you in the past and can provide insight into your abilities and work style.

#     It's important to note that including a reference section in a resume is not always necessary, and some employers may prefer to request references separately. If you do choose to include a reference section, it should typically be located at the end of your resume.

#     When listing references, be sure to include the individual's name, job title, company name, phone number, and email address. It's also a good idea to ask for the individual's permission before listing them as a reference, and to let them know what kind of job you are applying for so they can speak to your relevant skills and experience.

#     It's important to choose references who can provide a positive and comprehensive evaluation of your work. Avoid listing family members or friends as references, and instead focus on individuals who can speak to your professional abilities and accomplishments.
